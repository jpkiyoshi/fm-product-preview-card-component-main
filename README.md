## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that setting flex:1 on all flex items doesn't necessarily make them the same size, because the browser doesn't take in consideration the padding and/or margin of the different items. Also learned how to serve different images based on the viewport width.
